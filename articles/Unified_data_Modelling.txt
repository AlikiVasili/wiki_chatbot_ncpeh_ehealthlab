Unified Modeling Language
This section presents the Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams that provide a
visual representation of the NCPeH CY framework structure and functionalities in
Cyprus. Through this series of constructed diagrams, we illustrate the interactions
between various user roles within the system, including Administrator NeHA, NeHA
Operator, Pharmacy Operator, Pharmacists, and Physicians, and their respective
responsibilities and use cases. These diagrams serve as a blueprint for understanding
the system's architecture and the dynamic relationships that facilitate efficient
healthcare administration. By detailing the flow of operations and the scope of each
role's capabilities, these UML diagrams offer a comprehensive overview essential to
understanding the system's operational framework.
